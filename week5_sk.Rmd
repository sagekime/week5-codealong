# Part 1. T-tests

Mass comparison: male and female chinstrap penguins

```{r}
chinstraps <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Chinstrap") 

## Histogram
ggplot(data = chinstraps, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10) +
  facet_wrap(~sex)

## QQ plot
ggplot(data = chinstraps, aes(sample = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_qq() +
  facet_wrap(~sex)

## Get descriptive statistics
chinstraps %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_mass = mean(body_mass_g),
    median_mass = median(body_mass_g),
    sd_mass = sd(body_mass_g),
    sample_size = n()
    )
```

Get vectors of body_mass_g for female and male Chinstraps separately 

```{r}
chinstraps_f <- chinstraps %>% 
  filter(sex == "female") %>% 
  pull(body_mass_g)

chinstraps_m <- chinstraps %>% 
  filter(sex == "male") %>% 
  pull(body_mass_g)
```

### T-test, a couple different ways

1. Is there a significant difference in body mass between male and female Chinstraps?

```{r}
chinstrap_ttest <- t.test(chinstraps_f, chinstraps_m)
chinstrap_ttest

cohen.d(chinstraps_f, chinstraps_m)
```



2. Are male chinstrap penguins significantly larger than females?

```{r}
t.test(chinstraps_m, chinstraps_f, alternative = "greater")


```
